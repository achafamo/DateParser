"(datetime.datetime(2017, 8, 8, 0, 0), 't Tuesday at t')",Gender and Society in Africa,"        The National Model African Union is a simulation exercise which brings together student teams from over twenty colleges and universities across the country to take on the roles of African diplomats at a multilateral organization. Hosted by Howard University in Washington DC, the Model African Union gives students the opportunity to research and formulate resolutions for action to advance the cause of continental integration among the fifty-three member states of the African Union. This half credit course, which meets for the first five to six weeks of the semester, comprises the preparatory work for students wishing to participate in the national simulation. Our regular class meeting is once a week, Thursdays from 4-6 PM. On the week we leave for the model, we will meet Tuesday at that time (February 21). In addition, attendance at a series of three lunchtime briefings on our three assigned countries is required. In Washington, our trip will include visits to the embassies of the counties we will represent and briefings by diplomats accredited to the United States. We will also have an evening event hosted by Colgate alumni in the DC area. Each student will be assigned to a country delegation and to one of the standing committees of the Model African Union (Economic Matters, Social Matters, Peace and Security, Pan Africanism and Continental Unity, and Democracy, Governance, and Human Rights) or to the Executive Council, which will be tasked with a simulated crisis of continental proportions. The on-campus portion of the course will consist of background lectures on the history and structure of the African Union as a multilateral organization and training in the use of parliamentary procedure. A considerable amount of independent research is required of each student to produce a 10 page position paper and a resolution for submission to the simulation. Most expenses for the Washington trip are covered by the program in Africana and Latin American Studies, but students must be able to leave campus from noon on Wednesday, February 22 until Sunday evening, February 26, 2017. Students are responsible for informing their other faculty about their absence and will be responsible for any missed work in other classes.
